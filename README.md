Computer Science Registeration System
This program is used for Computer Science Studentâ€™s Registration System. There are
a few tasks that this program can do. The user especially computer science student can
choose the courses that they want to take. The program read the course list text file that
contain course name, course code and course unit. User can add the courses and drop back
the courses if they want. The data structures that we use for this program is singly linked list.
The course that have been chosen will stored in the node and point to the next node. This
program also will automatically calculate the total unit that the user add by course type or by
semester or overall total units. The other main function of this program is this program can
help the user to calculate their grade point average(GPA). What the user need to do is just key
in their grade for each course that they have taken. At the end of this program, the program
will display all the necessary information. The object oriented programming that have been
used in this program is aggregation which means a class is a member of a class. For this
program, the Student class is the member of another class which is NodeCourse. We use the
aggregation object oriented programming because there is a compositional relationship
between this two classes where Student class is composed of NodeCourse class.
